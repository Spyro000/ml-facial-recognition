# ml-facial-recognition
As part of my Advanced Machine Learning course, I have been tasked with developing a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of recognizing facial emotions. For this task, I will 
be utilizing the “Facial Expression Recognition (FER2013) dataset”, as specified by the 
assignment requirements. This paper serves as a report where I discuss the design pathway, 
experimental results, and findings of my project. 
The complete pipeline, from data exploration to model evaluation, is documented in the 
attached Jupyter notebook.
