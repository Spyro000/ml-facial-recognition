# ML Facial Recognition

As part of my **Advanced Machine Learning** course, I developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** capable of recognizing facial emotions.

This repository contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook with model code
- Pretrained model weights

### Dataset

The model was trained on the **Facial Expression Recognition (FER2013)** dataset, which is available at the following link:
